# Virtual-CMD
 A Virtual-CMD on C++

The main files are in the v-cmd folder and can be run directly.



I compiled it with visual studio code. In order to solve the problem of Chinese scrambling, I made a header file of my own and put it in the. Vscode folder. Users who need vscode can open it and have a look, but pay attention to modifying the compiler path when compiling.



Another: my interpreter is mingw64 of DEV-C + +, and the interpreter version is 4.9.2, which supports universal libraries. If your compiler prompts that it doesn't, you can download a DEV-C + +, and then set the path to mingw64 of DEV-C + +.



If you know python, you can go to my virtual console: https://github.com/glgele/virtual-console
